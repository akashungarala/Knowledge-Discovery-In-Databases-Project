# Knowledge Discovery in Databases Project

Built a database of countries listed on the website fsi.fundforpeace.org as a csv file. Used web sources like Wikipedia and annually published global reports to extract values for few new attributes to consolidate with the data set. Total is taken as the decision feature and discretized it into 4 intervals as the levels Alert, Warning, Stable and Sustainable. For classifiers construction, I used WEKA and applied different algorithms to choose the one that gives the highest precision and highest number of correctly classified instances. I have determined the action rules by using Weka by selecting the Rules-PART filter as the classifier and run for the data with total as the decision attribute.
